# Practice Java Problems
This is a project tracking the java work that I have done for the past few months. 
I will store notes as I do more practice.
## Git Notes
Parts of local git storage: unstaged area, staging area, commit history.
Whenever any changes are made or new files are added, they are unstaged.
When we do the command ```git add .``` those files are added to the staging area.
Next we do ```git commit -m "<some message>"```. This adds the files to the commit history.
We can combine these two commands if we have no new files and are just tracking modifications with the command ```git commit -am```

Finally, we push those changes to the remote repo using ```git push```.
